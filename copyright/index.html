<h1>ACL 2008 Publication Instructions - Main Conference</h1>

<h2>When and where do I send my final camera-ready paper?</h2>

<p>The deadline is April 21, 2008.  You may upload your paper starting April 1 via
the START Conference Manager: <A
HREF="https://www.softconf.com/acl08/papers/final.html">https://www.softconf.com/acl08/papers/final.html</A>.</p>

<h2>How should the final copy differ from the original
submission?</h2>

<p>The paper should be improved to address the comments of the 
reviewers, and in any other way that you see fit.  The final
version should, of course, not be anonymous:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Include the authors' names and affiliations under the title
  <li>De-anonymize references to your own work
  <li>Add acknowledgments where appropriate
</ul>  

<h2>How long can it be?</h2>

<p>At most 8 pages of text; one additional page containing only references is permitted.  <b>Short papers get 4 pages of text total (no additional page for references).</b></p>

<h2>What is the format for the camera-ready copy?</h2>

<p>The file must be in Portable Document Format (PDF) on US Letter paper
(8.5 x 11 inches).  Style files and detailed formatting instructions
<A HREF="http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/acl08/stylefiles.html">have been updated</A> since the submission
deadline, so please download the latest version.</p>

<p>If you are using LaTeX, please create the PDF file with
<code>pdflatex</code>.  This ensures use of the proper Type 1 fonts
and also takes advantage of other PDF features.  (If you can't use
<code>pdflatex</code> for some reason, use <code>latex</code>, and
then turn the resulting <code>dvi</code> file into <code>pdf</code>
with <code>dvips -Ppdf</code> (<b><i>do not use</i></b> <code>dvips
-Pps</code>).  See <a
href="http://dionysos.mpch-mainz.mpg.de/~joeckel/pdflatex/">here</a>
for a comparison of <code>latex</code> vs. <code>pdflatex</code>.)</p>

<h2>How do I ensure that my file is correctly formatted?</h2>

<p><b>Please check the paper size</b> by viewing your document in
Acrobat Reader.  The bottom of the window should show the size as "8.5
x 11 in."  Unfortunately, <code>pdflatex</code> is configured by
default to produce A4 output.  You can change this default by editing
your system's <code>pdftex.cfg</code> file, as described <A
HREF="http://physics.wm.edu/~norman/latexhints/pdf_papersize.html">here</A>.
If you don't want to change the default, you can change just this one
paper by adding three simple lines to its TeX or LaTeX source, as
described <A
HREF="https://engineering.purdue.edu/~mark/puthesis/faq/margins-pdflatex/">here</A>.
</p>


<p><b>If your paper uses Asian fonts,</b> please ensure that they are
encoded in the PDF file so that they can be displayed by non-Asian
versions of the PDF reader.  (Asian versions ship with a larger set of
default fonts.)  See <A
HREF="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/pdfs/acrasiafont.pdf">Adobe's
discussion</A> of this issue, which unfortunately does not discuss
LaTeX.  Suggested diagnostics and solutions are welcomed.</p>

<h2>What if my paper includes graphics?</h2>

<p>Remember that you are providing a camera-ready copy.  Thus, artwork
and photos should be included directly in the paper in their final
positions.  Resolution for raster images should be at least 160 dpi.
Avoid GIF or JPEG images that are low resolution or highly compressed.
If images contain screen gradients, do not use screen values below
20%.</p>

<p>Your paper must look good both when printed (8.5" x 11" size,
black-and-white) and when viewed onscreen as PDF (zoomable to any
size, color okay).  Thus, you may want to use color high-resolution
graphics, allowing onscreen readers to zoom in on a graph and study
it.  However, <i>please</i> check that the same graph or photograph is
legible when printed on a black-and-white printer.  For example,
different lines in a graph should not be distinguished only by color,
although they can <i>also</i> be distinguished by color.</p>

<p>A good test is to print the paper on your own black-and-white laser
printer, and to view it in a PDF viewer at different resolutions.</p>

<p>Don't go overboard on resolution; keep file sizes manageable.  Note
that vector graphics (e.g., encapsulated PostScript) look good at any
scale and take up little space (unless you are plotting many thousands
of data points).</p>

<h2>How about copyright?</h2>

<p>When you submit the paper, you will be asked to electronically or
physically sign ACL's <a href="ACL-copyright-form.pdf">Copyright Transfer
Agreement</a> on behalf of all authors.  Authors retain many rights
under this agreement.  The agreement linked above is appropriate in the
vast majority of cases.  A revised agreement that is more relaxed
in certain circumstances (e.g., work done for governments) is also available <a href="ACL-copyright-form-2008rev.pdf">here</a>.  If the latter form is appropriate for you,
please <a href="mailto:acl08pub@gmail.com">contact the publications chairs</a>.






<p>Before signing this form, please confirm with your co-authors (and,
if applicable, your and their employers) that they authorize you to
sign on their behalf.</p>

<h2>What if my paper's title or author list has changed?</h2>

<p>Then please edit those metadata fields when you upload the
camera-ready version, so that they will appear correctly in the table
of contents, author index, conference schedule, etc.</p>

<h2>My question isn't answered here ...?</h2>

<p>Please email the publications chairs (Joakim Nivre and Noah Smith) at <a href="mailto:acl08pub@gmail.com">acl08pub@gmail.com</a>.
We will update this page as new issues arise.</p>
